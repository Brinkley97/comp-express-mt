Kwabena was very patient.
I've got to handle my father's business.
When do we get out of there?
Do you want me to call you a car?
How many people does the number of traffic accidents kill each year?
I don't want you to talk to me in a different way.
He tried several times, but failed.
Kwabena knows those rules.

The family of parents and teachers are organizing school rules.
If you were playing the guitar, this could've happened.
The curtain is glowed in.
I don't understand this.
Kwabena needs to ask for advice.
I found out where he was.
I'm always cold during the winter.
Kwabena had a good teacher.
If she feels lonely, she don't mind.
He was often late for school.
All you have to do is wait for me to return.
I didn't have anyone to talk to.
Turn outside instead of watching TV.
If I know his address, I would write it to him.
He was not drunk.
I'd like to know where the money was hidden.
The key is on the table.
I wish I had the courage to eat with my hatch.
Abena killed the drug overdose and killed the drug overdose.
Those flowers are beautiful.

My car is small compared to yours.
I should ask you something.
Don't make me go to bed.

Asamoah was fired.
He was brave.
Aren't you sure it's dangerous to go out alone?
Kwaku walked into Abena's room.
The garden is surrounded by wood.

There was a large hole on the wall.
The room was covered with candle light.

These shoes are Kwaku's.
You don't speak French, do you?
The sun has out.
Read more, please.
I thought Abena was still in love with me.
I thought you were going to be able to swim in French.
You really can't say that.

Please choose a difficult word.
Whose car is this?
I like the way you sing.
This was the most interesting book that she had read ever.
Come as soon as possible.
Do you want to sit down?
Who shook you?
She plays the piano more than me.
I'll stand you in a stressful and stressful situation.
Is this a secret?
Who could fight against that?
He has a wife and doesn't have children and friends.
No one laughed at him.
Asamoah can be fired.
Kwabena didn't blame me.

I'm thirsty.
At last, it looks like summer has come.

The snow prevented us from going out.
It took me more than swo hours to understand a few English pages.
Asamoah is pretty.
Asamoah can see hatred.
Many children have such a hat.
I don't know what to do to swim.
Kwame grew up with an enthusiasm when he arrived.
The earth rotates around the sun.
Today is Monday. I'll do what I do every Monday.
Asamoah can't find the answer correctly.
How will you know that he was there?
He put his son in his arm.
I have a feeling that something is wrong.
Maybe I did it to stay.
Close the line.
Kwasi thought Abena would want to go to Boston to see John.
I have no reason for applying.
My daughter bought new furniture.
When do you make Aku cry?
The man is a very famous pianist.

We couldn't figure out what they wanted to say.
Let's just eat.

Whoever he comes, will make fun of him.
I don't know how to use this information.
Kwabena won three families.
Just listen to me.
If there were any more time to get back, what would you change?
Why did you do it?
The plants have started growing.

Hokkaido seemed that his family lived in Hokkaido.
Asamoah bought an apartment next to the lake.
You're in good mind.

Something you should know about me is that I'm an individualist.
I've seen Asamoah on TV again and again.

Do you know this lady?
Everything is in this area.
Who stole the cake?
You're lucky.

I'm going to clean the room.
I did that for you.
You look strong.

It may be more difficult for them to talk than we think.

My son wants to play with a car.
You're very clean.
Asamoah doesn't have any Japanese and English dictionary good.
Kwame and Abena understood John.
Thanks for your thoughtful present.

I need some time to think.
He knows why we understand.

Did you really say that?
Each employee must keep in charge of his own car.
I don't doubt that he is innocent.

Is this cup deodorant?
Maybe Kwaku't want to go.
The store caught fire yesterday night.
Wait outside.
We'd better go.
I had a toothache last month.
He doesn't study well, but he works well at school.
What do you expect to happen?
He attended the meeting in my favor.

My books are new.
His grandfather died of cancer last year.
I didn't swim well.
It's a very terrible situation.
I've left my umbrella in the bus.
I left my house at seven.
Then he put his hand on the paper, and realized it was a translator.
Polisi will never see us.
Asamoah didn't even try to help.
Let me try it.

There's something else that could happen.

He has been poor all his life.
Kwabena threatened to kill Abena.
Will you stop talking?
I've died and seen him again.

We saw Asamoah.
As soon as he comes away, we'll start.
I'm glad to meet you.
We went to the restaurant to tell you about me.
I really know why she was absent.
I'm warning you not to do it again.
How can you say such a thing?
This class will take ten minutes.
It'll be too hard to make a new version for you.
Kwabena told Abena something.
You can't go.
I was thinking about you.
Kwame gave Aba all the money she had on her.
We're glad you're coming.
I wish we could live in Australia.
He pretended to be a student.
Please tell me.
Abena believed what Abena said.
Tell me all you know about it.

Finally, their friendship ended, and cruel relationships ended.
There's only a little coffee.
Do you like the new job?
All he told us was all he said.

Do you think you're beautiful?
Kwabena has three children's brothers.
Asamoah has some money on his heart.
If my wife makes me angry, what should I do?
I asked him to make her comfortable.
Everybody knows that Asamoah is lying.
Who's responsible for the loss?
Kwabena is all I want.
The boy admitted that he had lied.
No one seemed to have the reason for the murder.
He was so nervous that he ran out of energy.
Did you have a conversation with your new classmates yesterday?
Asamoah knew it was a mistake.
Asamoah left something off the table.
It's a very nice tomato sauce.
Asamoah works for Esi.
Who's that boy?
She went shopping with him last Monday.
In Serbia, the train is very short.

Why doesn't she tell the truth?
Asamoah wants to eat an apple.
I want to live in Boston someday.
I was astonished.
I'll have it.
Asamoah wants me to join his team.
I'm sure Kwaku can do this job.
The rich man I know is Asamoah.
I don't believe in fate.
I think it's time for me to stop that idea.
You seem angry.
We often went to a movie on Saturday evening.
I was born the Fourth of the year in 1960.

He was born in England, but he was teached in America.
Everyone has something to hide.
I don't really know your name.
I didn't know French well.
Do you know when they'll come?
I taught myself how to play the guitar.
You must be pretty conceited.
I never for a moment imagined that I would continue to do such a thing when I was older.
Asamoah and Abena are afraid of John.
It's water.
I'd like that black there.

I met Abena yesterday in the street.
Please think.

It was a courage to go out.
That'll do so little by little.
He looked as if I had a lot of ways.
Smoking is prohibited in this area.
The violent people refused to be in touch.
Kwaku wanted to say a message to them.
I worked for over eight hours a month.
Let the workers go home early today.
Leave us alone.
The examination approved his theory.
It's your decision.
I can't tell you how to pronounce the word.
Where can I get a ticket?
I have a feeling that I should leave the house instead of staying at home today.

May I go home?
It took her ten dollars to get a concert ticket.
He was busy at homework.
Many children are involved.
The party was closed.
He was a little old man in thin glasses.
I don't want to see her again.
Asamoah is a good audience.
I think it's time for me to talk about it.
Is the night plane?
It was a clear day.
I spent more time with Asamoah.
If the war is held up, it will be possible.
I never for a moment imagined that I would meet you here.
I am clean in this room.
It's a very nice place.
He despise people who come to the ground.
I am convinced that my answer is true.
I've completely forgotten.
It's a reality that you can't deny it.
He has been found well.
Somebody needs to change his life!
Is there anyone in the house?
I've just considered you.
It's very clean.
The city was covered with snow.
He's a very interesting student.
Asamoah got on the car.
It was easy to persuade him for money.
I didn't know Kwaku could speak French at all.
Were you shooting your children?
Don't bother me anymore.
My father will quit working at the age of thirty.
She has a relationship with him.
Kwame has freckles.
The world began without a man. It's just going to end up.
I had a really good time yesterday.
Asamoah calmly.
The MP3 record is a memorable video.
I've already been here for swo hours.
He was happy in his children.
It's delicious.
We betrayed him as a mayor.
Do you have a little money?
It's dinner time.
You swo are very nice.
No one in the car.
Have been sick for another day or swo.
He pointed out that he was a clever in economic power.
Asamoah is kind to Abena.
He has glasses of eyes.
I'm not sick.
We've failed.

Wait!
Kwabena gained weight.
It's clear that he'll go to America.
The only answer that matters is the answer that makes other questions get up.
It's a problem now.
Vigorous exercise is necessary for a dog.
It has been with his black hair for years.
Don't just shut up. Don't be a thing!
I will stay till the end.
Kwabena doesn't know if he can visit us next Monday.
I told you all I heard.

We had a lot of food.
May you come on Sunday evening?
Asamoah wants to meet you.
It's up to me.

He began crying.
Asamoah hurt Boatemaa.
If you said the police would never see us here.
My sisters cooked dinner when I came home.
Asamoah is tallest and tallest.
I'm looking for a new job.
I thought I had until 2:30.
Were you going on a walk or a bus?
Are you sure he is a criminal?
My father gave me everything, just what I wanted.
We should listen to the fact that there is no country to control this country.
That's no danger.
Asamoah hasn't slept.
I'm three years older than him.
It hangs on a boy, a girl, and a cat.
How do you look at me?
Since I didn't know what to do, I asked a teacher for advice.
He said he didn't want this.
The decision I've taken to study abroad is a surprise of my parents.
Why didn't you come in, we'd talk about it.
He stopped smoking.
That lady hated me.
Look, I've got a long day and I just want to go to sleep now.
No one knew what to say.
Come after tomorrow.
Esi was babbling.
I owe you a lot about your help.
Give me something to drink.
He made up his decision on the red jacket.
There are a lot of furniture in Bavaria.
We like you.
He did the work swo days ago.
I pointed at him.
A policeman arrived at the scene of the crime.
I walked up in the woods when I arrived in the morning.
Nobody has loved her before.
You should resist that.
You don't need enemy when they have such friends.
I think we should ask Kwabena why he stopped his last job.
Let's pick up a large mountain.
Asamoah heard why you used it.
He went out of the room with a anger.
Have you ever eaten breakfast yet?
He began talking to the dog.
Some people are as animals as if they were nuts.
What Kwabena really wanted was completely new.
I was very tired yesterday.
Your tie looks good.
It's a really good idea.
Shut up!
walked fast.
Is there anyone who can pronounce this word?
What do you want to get?
I saw Asamoah kissing Abena.
Kwabena worked all day and was very tired.
.
You may go to the party, but you should go home after midnight.
He has so little money.
His word is useless.
I want to buy Asamoah a present.
He speaks fast.
Kwaku told me to go to church with him.
What are you looking at?
Biodiversity is a biodiversity.
The lake is deep here.
Kwabena goes to the mall almost every day.
Where's the book I need?
Kwaku got up all night.
I heard that he had passed the exam.
I'm shut up.
Can you do that by yourself?
Asamoah couldn't take the arm off his collar.
He likes his motorcycle very much.
Kwabena told Abena that study should be hard.
We live the same way.
I don't know what you mean.
It's time for you to sleep. This radio is on.
kabul is the capital of the country in that country.
I quit my job.
He weighs over 80kg.
Where's the blanket?
Kwabena did a big crime this year.
Kwabena was kidnapped in a rock and a hoax.
Do you need the book?
Asamoah didn't go to work as soon as he used to go every morning.
Do as you please.
A big flood ruined the plan for drinks.
He walked Paris to London.
Kwabena didn't know Abena was able to sing so well.
Asamoah had a blood on his shirt.
After reading the book, take it back to the scene.
Only one captain left their waves before.
Asamoah handed Aku a engagement.
Furniture is a good bargain.
Who wrote the Bible?
I seldom speak at the telephone.
These are mine.
Is that why you can't help Asamoah?
Our boss refused to approve our plan.
Don't you know he died swo years ago?
This is my sickness.
Nobody takes us seriously.
This is excellent.
Kwabena is still too young to drink beer.
I hope we'll see each other again soon.
Is it possible to eat cold?
It was yellow.
Did you read that dictionary?
I slept nine hours yesterday.
The business paid nothing.
I thought Asamoah was from Boston.

I got your letter.
He's very happy.
How did you know that I was Canadian?
How much time do you want to spend in Oxford?
It's time to go to sleep.

Don't forget your promise.
I know that Asamoah knows.
Give me the reason.
Take one for us.
I cry almost every day.
Asamoah tried to sell his TVCR unless he threw up, but nobody bought it, so he finally threw up.
Kwabena abandoned the music.
Asamoah has changed my mind.
Shut up your coat.

I don't want anyone to play my violin.
He approved my idea.
I swsted my legs.
I'm not going to send Kwaku a Christmas card.
Is there anyone?
Where's my red pen?

I have seen him up and down.
I often drink wine.
The flowers in the garden were green.
I don't have time to explain this in detail.
Kwabena has nothing to do with it.

The big news are Islam, Islam and Christianity.
You pay.
Our English teacher is always there.
I'm not hungry.
The pizzas were killed.
I don't know what I can say anymore.

May I dance like that?
It's not that hard to do.
I think you don't understand the question.
A woman came to see us when you were sleeping.
I couldn't have predicted it.
Asamoah was stupid enough to resist Aku to play some trombone.

I love her and she loves me.
What did you do this week?
You should afford to listen a little from now on.

Why is everybody so quiet?
It looks like you're alive.
I used to swim here every day.

I don't want to leave this story.
I want something else to add.
It wasn't too easy for me to stay with him.

They got married when they were young.
Who were you killing?
Nothing as important as peace.
I'm going to sell my car.
I like cooking.
He surprised me.
Don't leave the rope until I tell you.
It took me some time to understand what he was trying to say.
I know the boy standing over there.
We were told about his death.
A lonely man looks lonely because he is afraid of others.
Shut up!
Araba resembles her mother in appearance, but not in character.
Kwabena is an infecti.
His rank makes him able to do that.

Asamoah can't remember all his children.
He's a professional baseball player.
You might need a shovel.
I've never made this decision.
The girl I told you about her is here.
He told a lot about his father.
